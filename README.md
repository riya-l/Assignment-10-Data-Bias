# Assignment-10-Data-Bias

I learned how to use the Perspective API and how to read data from there from this assignment. Additionally, this showed me how to sort through large data sets and grab the information I needed.

In my findings, I was right in my hypothesis that more anti-female comments were marked as toxic than anti-male comments but what did surprise me is that even though the toxicity level was higher for anti-female comments, the anti-male toxicity level was also quite high.

My main question that I got from this project is that since the comments are opinion based, there is bound to be bias, but is there anyway to avoid bias in this case and will this bring us more accurate results?

A bias that I can think of that might exist in the model is survey about these comments who are super sexist towards the other gender which definitely skews the data.

As stated in my initial hypothesis, my results stated that more individuals mark anti-female comments as toxic when compared to anti-male comments and I believe this is because people generally feel like females are more emotional than males.
